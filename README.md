## Architecture

This project follows the **Screaming Architecture** pattern, which organizes code around features rather than technical concerns. This approach makes the codebase more intuitive and easier to maintain by grouping related functionality together.

### Project Structure

```
.
â”œâ”€â”€ app/             # Expo router application routes
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ _layout.tsx  # Root layout component
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ (app)/       # Main app routes
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ (auth)/      # Authentication routes
â”‚
â”œâ”€â”€ features/        # Feature-based modules
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ products/    # Products feature
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ categories/  # Categories feature
â”‚
â”œâ”€â”€ shared/          # Shared utilities and components
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ components/  # Reusable UI components
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ hooks/       # Shared custom hooks
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ providers/   # Third-party library providers
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ assets/      # Static assets
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ configs/      # Global configurations
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ utils/       # Utility functions

```

### Screaming Architecture Benefits

This architectural approach offers several advantages:

- **Intuitive structure**: The directory structure clearly communicates the purpose of the application
- **Domain-centered organization**: Code is organized by business domain rather than technical concerns
- **Feature cohesion**: Related code stays together, making it easier to understand and modify
- **Improved maintainability**: Changes to a feature affect only one directory
- **Clear boundaries**: Dependencies between features are explicit and controlled

### File Organization

Each feature follows a consistent file organization pattern that maintains clear separation of concerns:

- Components specific to a feature are contained within the feature directory
- Shared components and utilities are placed in the `shared` directory
- Routing and layout concerns are handled in the `app` directory

## Get started

1. Install dependencies

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

2. Start the app

   ```bash
   npx expo start
   ```

3. Run on your preferred platform

   ```bash
   # For iOS
   npx expo start --ios

   # For Android
   npx expo start --android
   ```

## API Integration

This app uses the [DummyJSON](https://dummyjson.com/) API to fetch product data. The following endpoints are used:

- `https://dummyjson.com/products` - Get all products
- `https://dummyjson.com/products/categories` - Get all categories
- `https://dummyjson.com/products/{id}` - Get product by ID
- `https://dummyjson.com/products/category/{category}` - Get products by category

## Development

The app is built using:

- **Expo Router**: For declarative routing and navigation
- **React Native**: For building the native mobile UI
- **TypeScript**: For type-safe development
- **TailwindCSS/NativeWind**: For styling components
- **React Query**: For server state management, caching, and data fetching
